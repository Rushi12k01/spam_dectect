Spam Message Identification and Word Visualization

This program is designed to identify spam messages from a CSV file and visualize the most commonly occurring words in both spam and non-spam messages. It utilizes the following libraries: wordcloud, sklearn, pandas, numpy, and seaborn.
Requirements

To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.x
    pandas
    numpy
    seaborn
    sklearn
    wordcloud

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn sklearn wordcloud

Usage

    Place the CSV file containing the messages in the same directory as the program.

    Run the program using a Python interpreter.

    The program will read the CSV file and preprocess the data.

    It will then use a Naive Bayes classifier from sklearn to classify each message as spam or not spam.

    The program will calculate performance metrics such as ROC AUC score and F1 score to evaluate the classifier's performance.

    Finally, it will generate a word cloud visualization to display the most commonly occurring words in both spam and non-spam messages.

File Structure

    spam_identification.py: The main Python script that performs spam message identification and word visualization.

Input CSV Format

The program expects the input CSV file to have the following format:
Message	Label
Buy one get one free! Limited time offer!	spam
Congratulations! You've won a trip to Hawaii!	spam
Hi, how are you doing?	ham
Urgent: Your attention is required.	spam
...	...

    The Message column contains the text of each message.
    The Label column contains the corresponding label, indicating whether the message is spam or not.

Output

The program generates the following output:

    Performance metrics:
        ROC AUC score: A measure of the classifier's ability to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.
        F1 score: A measure of the classifier's accuracy in classifying both spam and non-spam messages.

    Word cloud visualization:
        Two word clouds are displayed: one for spam messages and one for non-spam messages.
        The word clouds visually represent the most commonly occurring words in each category.

Customization

You can customize the program by modifying the following:

    CSV file: Replace the input CSV file with your own data.
    Classification algorithm: Instead of using Naive Bayes, you can experiment with other classifiers available in sklearn.
    Word cloud parameters: You can adjust the word cloud visualization settings such as color, font size, and background.
